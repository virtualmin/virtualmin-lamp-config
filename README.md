# virtualmin-lamp-config [DEPRECATED]
Part of the Virtualmin install process, a tool to configure the LAMP stack for Virtualmin usage.

This is here only for historic interest; it was pulled from our private git repo. But, the functions it provides have been replaced by a much more flexible, extensible, and modern, implementation found in [Virtualmin-Config](http://github.com/virtualmin/Virtualmin-Config), which is a modern Perl implementation of a plugin-based system.
